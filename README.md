# Computational Physics Exercises

This repository contains a collection of computational physics exercises for various levels of difficulty. These exercises are taken from different sources to provide a comprehensive set of problems that cover a range of topics in physics and computational science. The exercises are organized based on their difficulty levels and include both simple high school topics as well as more advanced concepts from beyond the first year.

## Sources

The exercises in this repository are sourced from the following places:
- [PICUP Exercises](https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/exercises/?EA=Standard,Specialized)
- [Texas A&M University PHY 401 Exercises](https://cyclotron.tamu.edu/rapp/401/phy401f06.html)

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the difficulty levels and topics of the exercises. Each directory contains a set of exercises along with example implementations in various programming languages. The directory structure is as follows:
